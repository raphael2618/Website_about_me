# ITC Precourse Project 

# HTML,CSS and Javascript Assignment

## Introduction

The project was developed with 3 programming languages: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I also used Bootstrap because I am skilled in it.

The project has 3 pages: 

1. **Index** : A photo of me and 3 buttons: LinkedIn, Stack-overflow and GitHub that redirects to my account page and a footer with a list of the 3 pages and a sentence.

2. **About** : It has some information about me: my qualifications, where I live and why I decided to join ITC. It also has the same footer as the Index page. 

3. **Contact** : It has a form with 5 fields: 
- First name, 
- Last name, 
- Email, 
- Comment, 
- Country,

 And a Submit button.

### JavaScript functionality
1. **Index** : Get the avatar and the name from GitHub page.

2. **About** : Change the maps contents according to previous / next buttons

3. **Contact** : Display all fields content of the form 
   
    Disable the submit button while one of the required fields is empty.
    
    Finally, the footer displays all the language that has been used in this project, according to an array.
